## Initial Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop a handy and easy-to-use app that allows the user to retrieve data regarding the current temperatures, as well as a 7 day forecast for a specific location area. Additionally, the app should be able to store user favorite locations where the user can easily select the saved locations from the home page to access weather.

## Collaboration - The Team

Thus far, as young developers we have been consistently reminded of the value of teamwork and successful collaboration. During this project, we had the opportunity to experience working among a team on a web application. It was neccessary toward the beginning to map out roles and responisibilities as best as possible to ensure equal commitment as well expound on each other's strengths while ensuring we build on any opportunity areas. We also discussed the basis of our MVP, the plan on how to reach our MVP, as well as talked about any bonus features we'd like to add if time allowed. We spent the beginning piece of the project ensuring that we all understood neccessary git commands that would allow us all to contribute to the master file remotely. We then mapped out tasks and assigned them accordingly to one another. We remained patient and engaged, while doing our best to communicate as clearly and consistently.

*Wireframe Design Tool


## General Requirements/MVP
Requirements for the project are as follows: 
1. Include data from a third-party API(weather API selected)
2. Integrate a Github Repo with our created React App, leveraging the selected API
3. Include React Router to handle the various views
4. Render neccessary data from the API
5. Follow Git Workflow
6. All team members must make roughly the same number of commits inside the project
7. App should be deployed to Surge

## Additional App Features

## User Stories

-As a user, I should be able to view the weather data for that specific location.
-As a user, I should be able to add/save up to three locations.
-As a user, I should be able to delete a saved location.
-As a user, I should be able to manuever through site easily.
-As a user, I should be able to access the home page from the data show page.
