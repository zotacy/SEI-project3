## Initial Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop a handy and easy-to-use app that allows the user to retrieve data regarding the current temperatures, as well as a 7 day forecast for a specific location area. Additionally, the app should be able to store user favorite locations where the user can easily select the saved locations from the home page to access weather.
## Getting Started
### Wireframe

## Collaboration - The Team
Thus far, as young developers we have been consistently reminded of the value of teamwork and successful collaboration. During this project, we had the opportunity to experience working among a team on a web application. It was neccessary toward the beginning to map out roles and responisibilities as best as possible to ensure equal commitment as well expound on each other's strengths while ensuring we build on any opportunity areas. We also discussed the basis of our MVP, the plan on how to reach our MVP, as well as talked about any bonus features we'd like to add if time allowed. We spent the beginning piece of the project ensuring that we all understood neccessary git commands that would allow us all to contribute to the master file remotely. We then mapped out tasks and assigned them accordingly to one another. We remained patient and engaged, while doing our best to communicate as clearly and consistently.

## App Components

|**Components**|**Description**|
|--------------|---------------|
|Header|Displays title throughout various web pages on site|
|Footer|Displays copyright info at bottom throughout various pages on site|
|Location Data| Displays rendered weather info data from the API for each day|
|Location| Displays Homepage with static city location data and options to find new location, as well as search for current day's weather|
|Location Search| Displays Search Page allowing user type in a new city location to access data|


## General Requirements/MVP
Requirements for the project are as follows:
1. Include data from a third-party API(weather API selected)
2. Integrate a Github Repo with our created React App, leveraging the selected API
3. Include React Router to handle the various views
4. Follow Git Workflow
5. All team members must make roughly the same number of commits inside the project
6. App should be deployed to Heroku





## App Features for Next Rendition
There were a few things that we thought would have accented our weather app. However, in support of ensuring a thorough and solid operating base app for our users, we decided to put a hold on these additions to focus on delivering a viable product that would include full functionality of the current features. One feature we hope to add in the future would be a "Saved Locations" task. With this function, the user would be able to add up to 3 of there most visited locations so they have those weather details handy as soon as they log into the app without having to search their favorite locations every time. Another app feature would be to incorporate Google Maps where the app would be able to access the user's location and provide the weather info for their current location. Though our app can operate fully without these features, the team believes these would provide an even higher user experience. 

## User Stories
- As a user, I should be able to click on a location.
- As a user, I should be able to view the weather data for that specific location.
- As a user, I should be able to add/save up to three locations.
- As a user, I should be able to delete a saved location.
- As a user, I should be able to manuever through site easily.
- As a user, I should be able to access the home page from the data show page.
- As a user, I should be able to access the current day's location while remaining on the homepage. 
- As a user, I should be able to gain an idea of weather conditions by viewing the images and gifs for each day.
